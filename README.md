# react-colorpicker

Design a React component that displays a square with 4 buttons below one. 
 * One button for red, one button for green, one button for blue, and one button to reset.
 * Each button press should increment the color value of that color by 15 and max out at 255.
 * The square should represent the color that represents the current RGB values.
 * The reset button should reset it all back to 0
 
## Hints
 * Do it in hooks
 * Do it using props at first, then use context
